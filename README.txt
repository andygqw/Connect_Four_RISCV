This is a demonstration of my work on connect-four game based on RISC-V environment.
Don't copy this for academic purposes. 
This implementation can be run on RISC-V simulator which provided by Prof. C.J. Nitta.

Above link is the RISC-V console simulator.

My code are mainly in main.c, interrupt.s, and startup.c

Thank you for viewing.
